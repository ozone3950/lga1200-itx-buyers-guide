Here is a detailed roundup of all the relevant ITX LGA1200 boards.

`"Why should I go ITX?"`

ITX is an underrated platform that many people do not know in depth about. Small form factor cases can be very space efficient and transportable, even with no compromises. 

`"What is 'ITX Tax?"`

'ITX Tax' is a term used regarding the extra cost of going the ITX route. ITX systems do usually cost more, but noawadays it's not bad at all. It can definitely be worth it if you want to go this route.

# Low End - Midrange Boards
These boards are for low-mid range CPUs such as the 10105F, 10400F, 10700F ect. They do not have CPU overclocking capabilities, since such CPUs won't either. This means that VRMs won't matter as much. However, they still do have XMP, so you are able to overclock your memory.

**Verdict**

For a budget 10105F/10400F level system, the ASRock B560M-ITX/AC will be the better choice. It is usually the cheapest board with XMP on 10th Generation CPUs, and has good enough VRMs to properly handle them.

For systems using a CPU like a 10700F or similar, the H570M-ITX/ac will probably be the best choice, since it has more USB ports, M.2 slots


# High End Boards
These boards are for higher end, unlocked CPUs such as the 10600K, 10700K, 10900K ect. The VRMs will matter more, therefore have been much more detailed in analysis. These boards are great for CPU and memory overclocking, with some features to assist with those tasks.
