# LGA1200 ITX Buyer's Guide

Here is a detailed roundup of all the relevant ITX LGA1200 boards.

`"Why should I go ITX?"`

ITX is an underrated platform that many people do not know in depth about. Small form factor cases can be very space efficient and transportable, even with no compromises. 

`"What is 'ITX Tax?"`

'ITX Tax' is a term used regarding the extra cost of going the ITX route. ITX systems do usually cost more, but noawadays it's not bad at all. It can definitely be worth it if you want to go this route.

`"Where should I buy one of these boards?"`

If you are able to find them for a good price new go ahead, but it's much more common for the prices to be better in the used market.

##### DISCLAIMER: NOT COMPLETE

# Low End - Midrange Boards
These boards are for low-mid range CPUs such as the 10105F, 10400F, 10700F ect. They do not have CPU overclocking capabilities, since such CPUs won't either. This means that VRMs won't matter as much. However, they still do have XMP, so you are able to overclock your memory.

## Verdict

For a budget entry level system using CPUs such as the 10105F or 10400F, the ASRock B560M-ITX/AC will be the better choice. It is usually the cheapest board with XMP on 10th Generation CPUs, and has good enough VRMs to properly handle them.

For systems using a CPU like a 10700F or similar, the H570M-ITX/ac will probably be the best choice, since it has more USB ports, M.2 slots and dual LAN which means it'll be better for productivity. The VRMs will also be more suited to handle CPUs which will perform better in more productivity focused workloads, aswell as gaming



# High End Boards
These boards are for higher end, unlocked CPUs such as the 10600K, 10700K, 10900K ect. The VRMs will matter more, therefore have been much more detailed in analysis. These boards are great for CPU and memory overclocking, with some features to assist with those tasks.

## Verdict 

This is a very close competition, but the winner is the MSI Z490I UNIFY. It has the best VRMs out of the boards being able to easily handle a 10900K, great RAM topology for memory overclocking, and even a clear CMOS button to make the overclocking process more efficient. Though the Gigabyte Z490I AORUS ULTRA is a close contender due to its insane rear IO, and VRMs nearly as good as the UNIFY.
